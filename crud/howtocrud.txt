This is a simple CRUD template that ties in with the NEWMODULE template
You can make more than one crud item by generating from template multiple times
Use multi file replace to replace:
i) (CASE SENSITIVE PLEASE) MOD_CRUDMODULE eg MOD_CST, then 
ii) CRUDMODULE eg cst, then 
iii) CRUD eg slidepair, 

By default the db table is called "items" and capabilities are itemview and itemedit
You could alter those in install.xml / CRUDlib.php and access.php

You will also need to 
a) add a link to the CRUDs in tabs.php and
b) add the lang strings from CRUDlang.php to the main lang file

The forms for each of the item types will be the first things you will want to customize
Backup and restore is not implemented yet.
